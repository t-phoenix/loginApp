Hello Developers
This is a small sample application made in vs code using react-native.

As I am relatively new to the technology, this repository is heavily inspired from documentation, google search, youtube tutorials, blog posts.

This application is UI tested on ios 12 .

Image folder contains image assets used i the application
Screen folder contains 4 .js files, among which 3 files are for splash screen, login screen, register Screen. While DrawerNavigationRoutes.js conatin navigation details.

Components folder contains customised components used as UI in the application
DrawerScreen folder contains the Home screen and Setting Screen available for toggle inside the application


Login and Register Screen doesnot support any backend, so they will validate the empty slots and let any character (NOT null) for the input fields.
Email, password validators can be included in future reference according to the need.


Drawer contains the Logout option to navigate back to Auth Screen.
